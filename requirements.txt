# These versions are selected to be recent while ensuring stability on
# low-performance, CPU-only hardware.

# --- Core AI & Machine Learning Libraries ---
# For PyTorch, it is CRITICAL to install the CPU-only version to save space
# and ensure compatibility on hardware without a dedicated GPU.
# Use the --index-url flag during installation, for example:
# pip install torch==2.3.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
torch==2.2.2
